# React-slack-clone
Slack clone using react and pusher chatkit 

# Notice
This app was using Pusher chatbit as a realtime chat backend, But since [pusher has taken down chatkit service](https://www.cometchat.com/blog/pusher-chatkit-is-shutting-down), this code doesnt work anymore. 
If you want you can migrate app to comet chat, by [following steps here](https://www.cometchat.com/blog/pusher-chatkit-is-shutting-down).
